# Streaming Systems

## Chapter 1 - Streaming 101

* Terminology: What is Streaming?
    * A *Streaming System* is a processing engine designed with infinite
    datasets in mind.
    * Data Cardinality
        * *Bounded Data* - Dataset that is finite in size.
        * *Unbounded Data* - Data that can be infinite in size.
    * Data Constitution
        * *Table* - A holistic view of a dataset at a specific point in time.
        * *Stream* - An element-by-element view of the evolution of a dataset over
        time.
    * Streaming systems have historically been considered limited to providing 
        low-latency, inaccurate, or speculative results, typically coupled with a
        batch system for eventually correct results.
        * This is the foundation of *Lambda Architectures*.
        * Lambda Architectures require maintaing two parallel systems: one
        that delivers quick results and one that delivers correct results.
        * [Questioning the Lambda Architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/questioning-the-lambda-architecture/)
        was a seminal blog post that detailed shortcomings of this architecture.
        * The idea is to use a replayable system (such as Kafka) as part of a
        single pipeline to achieve the task at hand.
    * To design a streaming system that can surpass Lamba Architecture, you
        need two things:
        * *Correctness*, which requires consistent storage.
        * *Tools for reasoning about time*, which will be discussed later in
        book.
* Event Time Versus Processing Time
    * *Event Time*
        * The time at which events actually occurred.
    * *Processing Time*
        * The time at which events are observed in a system.
    * In a perfect world, event time = processing time.
        * This does not happen in the real work.
        * The difference between Event Time and Processing Time is called
        *skew*.
* Data Processing Patterns
    * Bounded Data
    * Unbounded Data: Batch - Involves slicing up unbounded data into a
        collection of bounded datasets for batch processing.
        * *Fixed Windows* (aka *Tumbling Windows*)
            * Involves dividing up the data by fixed time range.
            * Presents some problems: What to do when events are received late?
            Some mitigation may be necessary, such as delyaing processing until
            all events are received.
        * *Sessions*
            * Sessions are periods of activity terminated by a gap of
            inactivity.
            * Increased complexity, because sessions may span multiple batches
            (when using a typical batching engine).
    * Unbounded Data: Streaming
        * *Time-agnostic* - Time doesn't matter, all logic is data driven.
        * *Filtering* - Remove elements from stream that don't meet certain
        criteria.
        * *Inner Joins*
            * When joining two unbounded sources, process when an element from
            both sources arrives.
            * When seeing a message from one state, buffer the message in a
            persistent state until the corresponding value arrives from the
            second source.
            * Requires some sort of garbage collection for messages that have
            no corresponding messages to join on.
        * *Approximation Algorithms*
            * Algorithms such as Top-N and k-means.
            * Relatively few exist, and are often complicated.
        * *Windowing* - Chopping data source along temporal boundaries into
            smaller processing chunks.
            * *Fixed Windows* (aka *Tumbling Windows*)
            * *Sliding Windows* (aka *Hopping Windows*)
                * A generalization of fixed windows. (If period is < length,
                windows overlap. If periods equal length, fixed windows.)
            * *Sessions*
                * Common for analyzing user behavior over time.
                * Lengths cannot be defined beforehand, they are dependent on
                the data involved.
        * *Windowing By Processing Time*
            * Create windows based upon when messages are processed.
            * Advantages: simple, "completeness" is straightforward, useful for
            inferring infomration about the data as it is observed (useful for
            application monitoring).
            * Downside: If the data has associated event times, the data must
            arrive in event-time order in order for the windows to be correct.
            This is problematic when events can't be received in a timely
            manner due to network faults. Messages received late have a high
            event-time skew. Windows may contain missing or out-of-date data.
        * *Windowing By Event Time*
            * Create windows based upon event. The "gold standard" of
            windowing.
            * Guarantees event-time correctness. Out of date messages get
            assigned to their respective event-time windows upon processing.
            * Drawbacks
                * Windows must exist for longer than the actual length
                of the window. This requires more storage for buffering.
                * It's impossible to gauge completeness, as we don't always
                know if we have all the data. Many systems provide heuristics
                to give a estimate of window compleition.
                * For situations where absolute correctness is required, custom
                means of closing windows must be implemented.

## Chapter 2 - The What, Where, When, and How of Data Processing
        
* A *trigger* is a mechanism for declaring when output for a window should
    be materialized relative to some signal. They make it possible to observe
    the output of a window multiple times as it evolves.
    * *Repeated update triggers* generate updated window panes as its
    contents evolve. These can occur on every new record at regular
    intervals. Usually used to balance latency and cost. These is the most
    common type encountered in streaming systems.
    * *Completeness triggers* materialize a window pane only after it's
    believed that all the input has been received. These tend to be more
    batch-oriented. Completeness triggers are driven by watermarks.
    * Per-record triggering is ideal for use cases where the output stream is
    directed at a table that can be polled for updates. These can be chatty. To
    mitigate chattiness, you can implement a processing-time delay.
    * The *aligned delay* approach is more predictable, but results in
    bursty workloads that require greater provisioning.
    * The *unaligned delay* approach spreads the load more evenly across time,
    but with less predictable latency.
    * Triggers are OK for eventual consistency. They are problematic with
    varying levels of skew. It makes it more difficult to determinate if
    output is accurate at any given point.
* A *watermark* is a notion of input completeness with respect to event
    times. A watermark with value `X` means that all input data with times less
    than `X` have been observed.They are the way the system measured progress and
    completeness relative to event time.
    * *Perfect watermarks* are based on perfect knowledge of input data. In
    this case, late data is impossible.
    * *Heuristic watermarks* use whatever information it get from the input
    data to provide an estimate of progress. These generally work well but can
    lead to ate data.
    * Shortcomings of watermarks:
        * Too slow: A watermark may be delayed due to known unprocessed data.
        Occurs when output depends on watermark avancement.
        * Too fast: When data with event times before the water mark arrive
        some time later.
    * The shortcomings of these individual types of watermarks can be overcome
        by using both types at the same time. Enter the *early/on-time/late trigger*,
        which partitions the panes into three categories:
        * > 0 *early panes*, which generate speculative results early on as the
        data arrive. This compensates for too slow watermarking.
        * At most one *on-time* pane, which results from watermark
        completions. This makes an assertion that the system believes it's
        received all input. Helps us reason about missing data.
        * > 0 *late panes*, which account for late data. This compensates for
        watermarks being too fast.
* *Garbage collection* is necessary for long-lived, out-of-order streamprocessing.
    * It's not practical to keep all persistent data from an unbounded data
    source.
    * It's necessary to place a *horizon* (or *bound*) on how late any given
    record may be relative to the watermark. Any date that exceeds the lateness
    horizon may be dropped without processing.
    * The horizon should be based on the event-time domain rather than
    processing-time domain. This ties garbage collection to progress on the
    pipeline. If tied to processing-time, data would be unnecessarily garbage
    collected if the system were to go down.
* An *accumulation mode* specifies the relationship between multiple results
    that are observed for the same window. What do we do with the existing data
    for each successive update of the window?
    * *Discarding* - Each time a pane is materialized, discard the stored
    state. Useful for replacing previous results.
    * *Accumulating* - Each time a pane is materialized, retain stored state and
    accumulate future inputs into existing state. Useful for overwriting
    previous results.
    * Accumulating and Retracting* - Same as accumulating mode, but with an
    independent retracting of the previous pane. "I previously told you the
    result was X. Get rid of X and replace it with Y". This is important for
    cases where downstream consumers are regrouping data by a different
    dimension. The retraction helps them correctly update their groupings.

## Chapter 3 - Watermarks

* Definition
    * With processing unbounded data, we want to solve problem of knowing when
    it is safe to call an event-time window closed, meaning that we don't expect
    to receive more data once the window closes.
    * A naive approach is to base windows on processing time, which fails when
    any hiccups or spikes in the pipeline cause us to incorrectly put messages
    into windows.
    * We can make one fundamental assumption about streaming data: each message
    has an associated logical event timestamp.
    * Def: The *watermark* is a monotonically increasing timestamp of the
        oldest work not yet completed. There are two fundamental properties of
        watermarks that make them useful:
        * *Completeness* - If the watermark has advanced past a timestamp `T`,
        no more processing will happen for on-time events at or before `T`. We
        can therefore materialize any messages for messages at or before `T`.
        * *Visibility* - The watermark stalls if a message gets stuck in the
        pipeline. We can debug the source of the problem by debugging the
        message that is preventing the watermark from advancing.
* Source Watermark Creation
    * In order to establish a watermark, we must assign a timestamp to every
    message entering the pipeline.
    * Once a watermark is created as perfect or heuristic, it remains so for
    the remainder of the pipeline.
    * Perfect Watermark Creation
        * Perfect watermarks are a strict guarantee that no late messages will
        occur.
        * Can be created when the source assigns ingress times as event times
        for data entering the system. Timestamps must come from a single,
        monotonically-increasing source. A downside to this approach is that it
        does not capture useful event processing times.
        * Can be created from static sets of time-ordered logs, like Kafka.
        This is more useful than ingress timestamping because the watermark
        track meaningful event times.
    * Heuristic Watermark Creation
        * An *estimate* that no data with event times less than the watermark
        will be seen again.
        * The better the heuristic watermark, the less late data.
        * This approach scales better.
        * Can be achieved by tracking minimum event times of unprocessed data,
        monitoring growth rates, and utilizing external information like
        network topology.
* Watermark Propagation
    * Most real-work pipelines consist of multiple stages. Each stage tracks
    its own watermark.
    * *Input watermarks* captures the progress for everything upstream of a
    stage. For sources, the input watermark is for source data. For non-source
    stages, the input watermark is defined as the minimm of the output
    watermarks of all upstream sources and stages.
    * *Output watermarks* capture the progress of a stage, and represents the
    minimum of the stage's input watermark and the event times of all nonlate
    active messages within the stage.
    * Subtracting input from output watermarks givesn the amount of event-time
    legacy (lag) introduced by the stage.
* *Percentile watermarks* are guarantees to have processed `X%` of all events
    with earlier timestamps.
    * This works in cases where "mostly correct" is sufficient.
    * The watermark advances more quickly and is not delayed by outliers, which
    lowers processing time.
* Processing-Time Watermarks
    * By only examining event-time watermark, you cannot distinguish between
    old data and a delayed system.
    * Processing-time watermarks provide a notion of processing delay separate
    from data delay.
    * An increase in processing time delay can be caused by networking issues,
    etc.

## Chapter 4 - Advanced Windowing

* When/Where: Processing-Time Windows
    * Use processing-time monitoring is appropriate for monitoring data as it's
        observed, such as monitoring web traffic. It's not appropriate for use
        cases for which the time events happened is important.
    * When working with a model where windowing is strictly event-time based,
        there are two ways to achieve processing-time windowing:
        * Triggers - Use a global event-time window.
        * Ingress Time - As data arrive, their event times are updated to match
            their ingress time.
    * The downside of processing-time windows is that the contents of the
        windows change when the observation order of the inputs changes.
        * Each section below illustrates two graphs with the same events. Both
            graphs process the same event at different times.
        * Event-Time Windowing
            * The results are the same even when observation order differs.
            * See [http://streamingsystems.net/fig/4-2](http://streamingsystems.net/fig/4-2).
        * Process-Time Windowing via Triggers
            * Observation time makes results different.
            * See [http://streamingsystems.net/fig/4-3](http://streamingsystems.net/fig/4-3).
        * Process-Time Windowing via Ingress Time
            * Observation time makes results different.
            * See [http://streamingsystems.net/fig/4-4](http://streamingsystems.net/fig/4-4).
    * tl;dr: Event-time windowing is order-agnostic, processing-time windowing
        is not.
* Where: Session Windows
    * Sessions are a type of window that capture a period of activity in data
        followed by a period of inactivity.
    * Useful for measuring user activitiy.
    * Session windows are an example of data-driven window: the location and
        window sizes are a consequence of the input data themselves.
    * They are also an example of an unaligned window: the window does not
        apply uniformly across data (contrasts with fixed and sliding windows
        which apply uniformly across data).
    * Sometimes the windowing key is known in advance (i.e. a session ID).
        Other times, the session window is created created out of set of
        smaller, overlapping windows containing a single record.
* Where: Custom Windowing
    * Most systems don't support custom windowing, except Beam. This section
        just focuses on Beam.
    * A custom windowing strategy consists of two things: window assignment and
        window merging.
    * Variations on Fixed Windows
        * Fixed Windows
            * Elements are placed into the appropriate fixed-window based on
                its timestamp and the window size and offset parameters.
        * Unaligned fixed windows
            * Aligned windows all close at the same time, which causes CPU
                usage bursts.
            * Unaligned windows spread window completion out over time at the
                expense of not being able to compare data across windows.
        * Per-element/key fixed windows
            * Element data determines window size.
            * Useful when you want to support arbitrary window sizes.
            * Example given is a Cloud Dataflow customer that generates
                analytics data for its customers. Each customer is allowed to
                configure the window size over which it aggregates metrics.
    * Variations on Session Windows
        * Implementation
            * Assignment: Each element is placed into a proto-session window
                that starts at the element's timestamp and extends for the gap
                duration.
            * Merging: At grouping time, all eligible windows are sorted.
                Overlapping windows are merged together.
        * Bounded Sessions
            * Sessions that are not allowed to grow beyond a certain size.
